# I'm going to need you to do some work for me. I need you to write a class for
# a stack. It should have the methods push, pop, and size. LIFO (last in first
# out) means that the last element added to the stack should be the first one
# removed. So if you push on 3, and then push on 2, and then push on 1, you'll
# need to pop off 1 first, then 2, then 3. Make sure you return the value that
# is being popped off.

# Example usage:
# s = Stack()
# s.push(1)
# s.push(2)
# s.push(3)
# s.size() # should return 3
# s.pop() # should return 3
# s.pop() # should return 2
# s.pop() # should return 1
# s.size() # should return 0
